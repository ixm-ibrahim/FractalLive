julia centering for lambda
setting for inverting camera controls
remove degreestoradians for RotatePitch/Yaw (and all other instances where turnSpeed is used)
test if FromAxisAngle requires a normalized axis
should arcball rotating have its own speed?
follow random center of fractal (ai?)
convert right variables to doubles
more functions to break down larger functions
focus glControl upon application start
enable copy and paste in textboxes
undo redo
left click decides orbit trap point and others
see if raising zoom to power can be optimized in shaders
minimize calls to GL.Uniform
focus glcontrol after each winforms input
test max float value
investigate behavior when bailout is between 0 and 1
optimize glsl arithmetic
complex powers for power and c_power
snap values textbox
optimize main cardioid and other areas - as long as color calculation doesn't require the right iteration
minIterations with "first"" orbit trap not working
lambda distance estimation bug
popup if user inputed high value which may slow down machine (get rid of unnecessary <type>bounds)
showcase how fold offset shows more detail without zooming
make ints floats so ctrl modifer can be used
camera axis bug
camera precision bug
when no buttons are pressed, don't calulate any values (still image whose values gets passed to new shader that only cares about colors)
make riemann angle gimbal lock? (rotate with spherical coordinates)
flat riemann camera controls and aspect ratio
lower resolution
miniterations can't exceed maxiterations-1
third texture bug
interior texture
other ifs fractals (weather one, etc.)
post iterations (smooth coloring)
animate textures, julia, orbit traps

julia set (different shader), animation menu, julia set matings (different shader), complex power, terrian, julia minimap, load save settings, doubles and quads
