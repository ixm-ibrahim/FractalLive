julia centering for lambda
setting for inverting camera controls
remove degreestoradians for RotatePitch/Yaw (and all other instances where turnSpeed is used)
test if FromAxisAngle requires a normalized axis
should arcball rotating have its own speed?
follow random center of fractal (ai?)
convert right variables to doubles
more functions to break down larger functions
focus glControl upon application start
enable copy and paste in textboxes
undo redo
left click decides orbit trap point and others
see if raising zoom to power can be optimized in shaders
minimize calls to GL.Uniform
focus glcontrol after each winforms input
test max float value
investigate behavior when bailout is between 0 and 1
optimize glsl arithmetic
complex powers for power and c_power
snap values textbox
optimize main cardioid and other areas - as long as color calculation doesn't require the right iteration
minIterations with "first"" orbit trap not working
lambda distance estimation bug
popup if user inputed high value which may slow down machine (get rid of unnecessary <type>bounds)
showcase how fold offset shows more detail without zooming
make ints floats so ctrl modifer can be used
camera axis bug
camera precision bug
when no buttons are pressed, don't calulate any values (still image whose values gets passed to new shader that only cares about colors)
make riemann angle gimbal lock? (rotate with spherical coordinates)
flat riemann camera controls and aspect ratio
lower resolution
miniterations can't exceed maxiterations-1
interior texture
other ifs fractals (weather one, etc.)
post iterations (smooth coloring)
animate textures, julia (circle, factor*fractal edge, etc), orbit traps, rotate normals
press g to reset camera
hide controls that aren't relevant altogether
exiting the form while mating steps fails or fail textbox validating bug
julia mating update on another thread
distance estimation on riemann sphere bug
no riemann adjustment for julia mating?
you can resize color dialogue
custom colors
change initial radius on corner resize
replace julia textboxes with comboxes with included nice julia locations
conslidate input_EditingColor_SelectionChangeCommitted
pause and continue julia matings
raytraced mandelbulb and quaternions
interior julia -1,0 orbit trap bug
array of whatever orbit trap I want
match orbit trap with normal orbit traps bug
interior with rectangle orbit traps bug
mandelbrot/julia orbit trap
adding too many lines (points too?) bug
match orbit trap for texture
bailout texture cutoff bug
stripes zooming bug
uses closest periodic point rather than fixed
julia matings middle ground bug
orbit path on left click (new shader)
