sjulia centering for lambda
setting for inverting camera controls
remove degreestoradians for RotatePitch/Yaw (and all other imstances where turnSpeed is used)
test if FromAxisAngle requires a normalized axis
should arcball rotating have its own speed?
see if currentCamera can be replaced with a Mode
figure out culling
roll 2d vs 3d
shader SetDouble, Vector2d
camera roll
initial zoom conditions
follow random center of fractal (ai?)
convert right variables to doubles
more functions to break down larger functions
focus glControl upon application start
enable copy and paste in textboxes
undo redo
text box that spawns input textbox/combo box when clicked
interior orbit trap and more options (like skipping n iterations, pausing zoom coloring)
left click decides orbit trap point and others
see if raising zoom to power can be optimized in shaders
investigate bug where Update is called after exit, and menu disappears
adjustable zoom factor
replace line and cross orbit trap with lines, and point with points (up to 3)
minimize calls to GL.Uniform
