julia centering for lambda
setting for inverting camera controls
remove degreestoradians for RotatePitch/Yaw (and all other imstances where turnSpeed is used)
test if FromAxisAngle requires a normalized axis
should arcball rotating have its own speed?
see if currentCamera can be replaced with a Mode
figure out culling
roll 2d vs 3d
shader SetDouble, Vector2d
initial zoom conditions
follow random center of fractal (ai?)
convert right variables to doubles
more functions to break down larger functions
focus glControl upon application start
enable copy and paste in textboxes
undo redo
left click decides orbit trap point and others
see if raising zoom to power can be optimized in shaders
investigate bug where Update is called after exit, and menu disappears
adjustable zoom factor
minimize calls to GL.Uniform
load and save settings
focus glcontrol after each winforms input
lighting menu
normal maps in lighting menu
key for cycling orbit traps/colorings (+/- ?)
deal with interior colorings that wont work
test max float value
investigate behavior when bailout is between 0 and 1
optimize glsl arithmetic
complex powers for power and c_power
snap values textbox
minIterations with first orbit trap not working
optimize main cardioid and other areas - as long as color calculation doesn't require the right iteration
consolidate keypress as most of them only look for a single value
consolidate IsWithinOrbitTrap
match orbit trap exposed bug in middle of cardioid
separate smooth setting
fix min iterations bug
lambda distance estimation bug
popup if user inputed high value which may slow down machine (get rid of unnecessary <type>bounds)
showcase how fold offset shows more detail without zooming

folds, textures, adjustable time with arrow keys, different projections (including flat riemann) and camera, stripe average coloring, custom, julia set (different shader), julia set matings (different shader), lighting (different shader?) and menu, julia minimap, load save settings, complex power
